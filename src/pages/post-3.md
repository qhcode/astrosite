# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-02-27

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. Attempted to go to DenverScript this month. Failed miserably.
1. finally got my neovim config to where it should be - with correct astro markup.
1. spent a bit learning lua on learnxinyminutes.com, and spot-checking some other useful languages and tools.
  1. turns out I know most of TypeScript already - at least, the useful parts. I've not yet truly found a real live use case for generics, although it seems like they couldbe useful. I'll continue to poke at my TypeScript fundamentals course at - hopefully before the testing stream comes out on the 5th.
1. Updated homebrew, installed ripgrep and did some other research.~


## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
