# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-03-09

## What I've accomplished

Read a lot about the node.js event loop - watched Matteo Collina's video on it and read the linked Nodesource blog post closely.

It introduced the count of "event loop utilization", which in a normal web server context is important in determining the threshold at which 503 error responses are returned.

In my current application(s), there aren't so many performance issues... but the details matter! I might encounter something like this someday.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
