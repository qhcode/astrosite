# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-02-29

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. Today was the first day in which I had to remind one of my engineers to "ignore what ChatGPT is saying and google the documentation instead". I imagine this will be a common thing going forward.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
