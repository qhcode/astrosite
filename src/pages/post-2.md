# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-02-20

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. learned about goroutines
- I've always read that Go had a fancy concurrency model

1. read some of the source code for **gherkin-lint-ts.**
- I've been curious about how a gherkin linter can be implemented - and it's a lot simpler than I thought.


## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
